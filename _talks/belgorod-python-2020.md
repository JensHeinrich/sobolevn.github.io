This talk was about code complexity.

I have shown how different complexity metrics work.
Even one that I have invented myself: Sobolev's complexity.
I also gave a bunch of tools to fight
the complexity on all levels of abstractions.

Currently, there's no video available.
But, there's a [full recording](https://vk.com/fabit_ru?z=video-120158819_456239053%2Fe0b8576726e08f303b%2Fpl_wall_-120158819).
