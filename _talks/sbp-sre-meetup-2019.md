We do not have SRE culture in [wemake.services](https://wemake.services).
And we somehow manage to live without it. A lot of people ask about it.

This talk covers a lot of tools and practices
that we actively use to decrease the negative effect of lack of SRE.

And it also raises an important question to think about:
