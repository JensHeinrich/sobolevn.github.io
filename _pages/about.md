## Work

I work as a CTO at [wemake.services](https://wemake.services),
I am also happen to be a founder of this company.

The thing I like about my job is freedom, I can:
- Create new products for our clients
- Write a lot of [open-source code](https://github.com/sobolevn)
- Work on processes in our company, that's exactly how I came up with [`RSDP`](https://wemake.services/meta/)
- Spread a word about what I do with my [blog posts](https://sobolevn.me/) and [conference talks](https://sobolevn.me/talks/)
- Participate in different closely-related [activities](https://sobolevn.me/activities/)

## Stack

I work with `python`, `elixir`, and `javascript` (`typescript` too).
But, I am also familiar with *many* other languages.

You can check my [`.dotfiles`](https://github.com/sobolevn/dotfiles) to get
the exact the same setup as I have.

## Conferences I organize

I am also helping to organize several meetups and conferences:
- [ElixirLangMoscow](http://elixir-lang.moscow/) which I founded back in 2016
- [MoscowPythonConf](http://conf.python.ru) where I am a Program Committee member

## Education career

I also like to spread the limited knowledge I have.
I worked as a professor in several universities in Russia:
- [MosPolytech](https://mospolytech.ru/) in 2017
- [RANEPA](https://www.ranepa.ru/) in 2018

And I have also created several
independent courses for `#tceh`, `iidf`, and `Numa Moscow`.

## Identity

I don't have any social network accounts or any messengers.
You can only find me on platforms that are listed below on this page.

I am using [`keybase`](https://keybase.io/sobolevn) to identify
my verified online accounts.
