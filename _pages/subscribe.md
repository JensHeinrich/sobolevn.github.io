## RSS

You can subscribe to my blog posts with [`RSS`](https://sobolevn.me/feed.xml).
You can also subscribe to my [Activities](https://sobolevn.me/feed/activities.xml) and [Talks](https://sobolevn.me/feed/talks.xml) feeds as well.

If you don't know what `RSS` is, then it is not your choice.
Consider email subscription.
