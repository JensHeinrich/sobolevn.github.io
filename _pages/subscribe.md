## RSS

You can subscribe to my blog posts with [`RSS`](https://sobolevn.me/feed.xml).
You can also subscribe to my [Activities](https://sobolevn.me/feed/activities.xml) and [Talks](https://sobolevn.me/feed/talks.xml) feeds as well.

If you don't know what `RSS` is, then it is not your choice.
Consider Github subscription.

## Github

You can also [follow me on Github](https://github.com/sobolevn)
and be notified about everything I do, no just blog posts.

Or you can watch only [blog repository](https://github.com/sobolevn/sobolevn.github.io)
for new changes.
